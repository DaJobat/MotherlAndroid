when drawing map on screen, need to make sure that tiles hidden by other tiles don't draw, also need to make sure that background layer draws first, then middle, then foreground
probably want to make sure player move speed isn't final so that it can be altered by pickups, unless we use multipliers. actually, on second thought having final base move speed is a good move, multipliers for upgrades.
for drawing chunks, load maybe 30x30. actually load more horizontally? 900 tiles. check performance.
0.3f seems to be a good zoom level, maybe still too far
